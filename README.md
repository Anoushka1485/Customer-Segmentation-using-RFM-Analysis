# Customer Segmentation using RFM Analysis

This project applies RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to an eCommerce dataset to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. The goal is to generate actionable insights that support targeted marketing and customer retention strategies.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and contains transactional data from an online retail store:
- Customer IDs
- Order details
- Product information
- Transaction dates
- Monetary values
- Country and payment-related details 

## Project Objectives
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean data, handle missing values, remove duplicates, and convert data types.
- **RFM Calculation:** Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
- **RFM Scoring:** Assign RFM scores using quartiles or custom bins and create combined RFM scores.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Segment customers using clustering techniques such as K-Means.
- **Segment Profiling:** Analyze characteristics of each customer segment.
- **Marketing Recommendations:** Provide tailored marketing strategies for each segment.
- **Visualization:** Use charts and plots to illustrate RFM distributions and customer clusters.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
